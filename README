how to prescribe wind stress?
according to ZCdoc, HTAU is wind stress anomaly
according to ztmfc1.f, HTAU seems the total wind stress
405       HTAU(J,I1,1)=(A1*AT-A3*AM)*.0329+UT(I,J)
406       HTAU(J,I1,2)=(A2*AT-A4*AM)*.0329
I used anomaly (tauxy_ano.bin) to prescribe HTAU, successed

90 year test run:
just run zeq1main.f, modify the fctest.data file
in this case, the first 5 months ocean forced by 0.25m/s uniform westerly wind anomaly in a small region defined by JLEFT JRT ITOP IBOT, after 5 months there is no external wind (NIC=4,TCUT=5,TAMP1=0.25)
100 model years take 10s CPU time

how to output var?
sample output code is in zeq1main.f
sample plotting code is the ncl file
set up the model in fctest.out:
TZERO the initial month for the run, 0.5 means middle of the month
TENDD the final month for the run. 
NTAPE=3 means write hist file every 3 steps, i.e. monthly output, not the
monthly mean but the last step in each month.
NTAPE=0 means only one output at the end
NT is the current number of step, counter in main
NTIMES is the total steps, calculated from TZERO and TENDD
TPLMIN: earliest time that history output will be written. see fctest.data

where is heat flux, wind stress, bottom temperature in this model?
no input heat flux, only newton's cooling 
wind stress is computed in ztmfc1.f using the relationship between wind stress and wind speed
  HTAU(J,I1,1)=(A1*AT-A3*AM)*.0329+UT(I,J)
  HTAU(J,I1,2)=(A2*AT-A4*AM)*.0329
HTAU is used by cforce.f
no bottom temperature, only subsurface temperature, TD in ssta.f
Tsub is not constant

how ocean impacts the air?
Through SST, see Eq. A1-3 (ZC1987), each step u v p determined by SST only
uvp does not revolute in air model

how air impacts ocean?
only throught HTAU
u v determined by SST and last convergence(Qs Ql in Eq A3), and inturn impact the HTAU, hence force the ocean (A4-5 in ZC1987)
HTAU(ztmfc1.f)->HT(cforce.f)->G,F->T1T2T3(uhcalc.f)->R->u h

There is no heat flux, how does ocean get energy?
This is anomaly model, (I guess) there is only re-distribution of SSTA
newton's cooling is like restoring boundary condition at the climatology SST

for model details, see ZC1987 and someone's PhD thesis

data files are in binary format for an SGI machine: i.e. big-endian

big_endian and little_endian:
(1)gfortran -fconvert=big-endian [native,swap,little-endian,big-endian]
(2)pgi compiler: -byteswapio
ps: another way is to change the code: open(...convert='big_endian'...)

The file fctest.data can be used to run a test case;  

another test run: run the model for 90 years and compare with ZC1987 Fig 1

read user's guide in ZCdoc, including model domain, all parameters(listed in fctest.data), variables, data files (rcwndmn.data,rcdivmn.data,rcsstmn.data,wem.zeb,uv.zeb, see openfl.f)

constant model

for HTAU(34,30,2), for others VAR(30,34)
UO VO are wind speed m/s
HTAU is wind stress dy/cm2
WM(30,34,2,12) is 12 month wind stress

fctest.data and fctest.out are formatted files, can be read by vim
setup.f and setup2.f read and write parameters in fctest.data

forcedmain.f: another testrun forced by prescribed NCEP forcing, tauxy_ano_NCEP.bin is forcing data for 62 yr (1950.1-2011.12)

there are 2 sets of codes: zeq1main.f and forcedmain.f
other needed codes shown in makefile_zeq1main

zeq1main.f is coupled ZC

forcedmain.f is forced ZC with prescribed wind stress

fixed warning in ztmfc1.f and cforce.f, marked by liang

how to run the coupled case:
(1)make -f makefile_zeq1main  #don't miss -f
   or
bash compile_zeq1main (I prefer this way,I created this compile bash file)
(2) ./a.out

how to run the forced case:
(1)bash compile_forcedmain
(2)./a.out

about data file size:
49056 rcdivmn.data
49056 rcsstmn.data
98016 rcwindmn.data
sequential method adds 8 extra bytes (4 at the head and 4 at the tail) for each write and read
49056=(30*34*4+8)*12
98016=(30*34*2*4+8)*12
I created the wind stress data tauxy_ano_NCEP.bin, direct access size=34*30*2*744*4
